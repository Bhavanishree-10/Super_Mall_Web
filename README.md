🛍️ Super Mall Web – Mall Management Web Application
📌 Project Overview

Super Mall Web is a web application designed to simulate a complete mall management system where merchants can list their shops, manage offers, and showcase products. Customers can browse categories, view offers, compare products, and explore shop-specific details.
This project demonstrates real-world e-commerce and mall operations using frontend technologies integrated with Firebase backend services.

A portal for merchants to manage shops and offers

A front-facing user interface for customers to explore products, categories, and offers

A scalable and modular web solution using web technologies and Firebase
